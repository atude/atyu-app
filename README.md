### What is Atyu?
Atyu is a Mac/Windows app that lets you configure OLED (and other) settings for QMK keyboards. It uses a [fork of QMK](https://github.com/atude/qmk_firmware) that includes preset mods that can be set by the app, and installed directly to your keyboard. 

Atyu can receive updates from the QMK fork from within the app's settings, so you can get the latest mods without having to reinstall this app.

### Installation Requirements
- [QMK (QMK MSYS if using Windows)](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_getting_started?id=set-up-your-environment) (you only need to do step 2)
  - On Windows, you **must** install QMK MSYS in the default directory

### Supported Keyboards
- Satisfaction 75
